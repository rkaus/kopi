An rkaus coffee house production

## TODO

1. replace contact me with google form (howto: https://codepen.io/simsketch/pen/GNRLzG)
  * alternatively can try AWS lambda SES implementation

2. payment/paypal implementation

3. customize css
  * shrink Header size
    * really?
  * Change Coffee pictures and descriptions
  * adjust color palette
    * FIX: The active pane marker on the navbar is black instead of transparent


# rethink how this website is going to be distributed and what content it should display
1. is it a sales portal?

2. is it an informational website?
  * what about snackable assets

3. is it purely a way to get in touch with Rishi?
